Find it kinda annoying to open graphical windows when using i3, and I'm not used to floating windows yet. 

Anyhow, GPT made this, so I made this 

## `SwitchAudioSink.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List all sinks and use fzf to allow the user to select one
selected_sink=$(pactl list short sinks | fzf --height 40% --border | awk '{print $1}')

# Check if a sink was selected
if [ -z "$selected_sink" ]; then
    echo "No sink selected, exiting."
    exit 1
fi

# Set the default sink to the selected one
pactl set-default-sink $selected_sink

# Move all currently playing audio streams to the new sink
pactl list short sink-inputs | cut -f1 | while read stream; do
    pactl move-sink-input $stream $selected_sink
done

echo "Sink changed successfully."
```

## `SwitchAudioSource.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List all input sources and use fzf to allow the user to select one
selected_source=$(pactl list short sources | fzf --height 40% --border | awk '{print $1}')

# Check if a source was selected
if [ -z "$selected_source" ]; then
    echo "No input source selected, exiting."
    exit 1
fi

# Set the default input source to the selected one
pactl set-default-source $selected_source

echo "Input source changed successfully."
```
